/**
 * Unlock reveal for our background, timed to the launcher's own "user present" animation.
 *
 * <p>The launcher plays its unlock fly-in entirely inside its Flutter scene. On HyperOS 4 the whole
 * workspace is projected in 3D and every item - the dock row included - travels forward by the same
 * depth step (70.49 at a camera distance of 346.41 on the reference device, read from
 * {@code _UnlockWidgetState.showUserPresentAnimation}). None of that crosses a process boundary:
 * the native motion channel stays at {@code entry=0} for the whole animation, and the launcher's
 * 2D diagnostics ({@code hotSeatScale}/{@code hotSeatTranslateY}/{@code hotSeatAlpha}) are constant
 * identity on this ROM, so they cannot be mirrored either.
 *
 * <p>A child SurfaceControl cannot join a transform that is rasterised inside the launcher's own
 * buffer, so the reveal is reproduced here instead: the background grows, rises and fades in over
 * the same measured window (821 ms, {@code _showPresent} -&gt; {@code endAnimation}) starting from
 * the same moment the platform stops showing the keyguard.
 *
 * <p>This type is deliberately free of framework references so the timing stays testable.
